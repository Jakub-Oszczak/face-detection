# face-detection
Warning: Majority of this code was taken from an online course, it's not mine and was only intended for learning purposes

This is a simple face detection program. As its input it takes video from your webcam then detects faces and returns webcams live image with squares drawn around detected faces.
To quit the program press 'q' or 'esc' button.

While making this program I've learned a bit about opencv module and how to use pretrained AI models.
